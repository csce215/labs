You may be wondering when will all this knowledge be useful. Well, it will be useful in so many situations (including in your daily life as a computer user), but in this lab, we will give an example from a professional perspective as a Fullstack Software Developer.

## First Act

One normal day at the office, you were happily coding when suddenly you got the following email:

You know that the company's website backend runs in the server *L-1D43-01.cse.sc.edu* (SSH allowed in port 222) and that the logs (files with all the transactions of the website) are located in a directory called something like *logs* somewhere in ~/company/website

*Question: What should you do?*
